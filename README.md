# Task Management Application

## Objective
This is a simple task management application designed to help users keep track of their tasks with a focus on core functionality and a user-friendly interface.

## Features

### Dashboard
- Upon accessing the application, users are presented with a dashboard displaying their tasks.
- Tasks are categorized into **Upcoming Tasks**, **Overdue Tasks**, and **Completed Tasks** for easy access and organization.

### Task Management
- Users can **add**, **edit**, and **delete** tasks.
- Each task includes:
  - Title
  - Description
  - Due date
  - Priority level (High, Medium, Low)

### Priority Levels
- Three priority levels (High, Medium, Low) help users classify tasks based on importance.
- Users can set or update the priority level of each task to better organize their workload.

### Search and Filter
- **Search** functionality allows users to quickly find tasks by title or description.
- **Filter** options enable users to view tasks based on:
  - Priority level
  - Completion status (e.g., upcoming, overdue, or completed)
